The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is arguably the world’s largest conservation
program on private lands, with $1.8 billion paid to farmers in 2017 for practices on 23.4
million acres. Existing theory and literature suggest that a modified auction structure
could make CRP more cost effective. Using a laboratory experiment, we study several
auction alternatives and test their efficiency and cost-effectiveness. We begin with an
analysis of variation in price-cap tightness, since the current format is similar to a tight
price cap. We find that excessive tightening of price caps forces participants out, damaging
efficiency and cost effectiveness. Substantial relaxation of the price cap hurts costeffectiveness
by allowing higher rents. Given these challenges, we also consider two alternative
formats based on reference prices, which are determined either exogenously
or endogenously. The exogenous reference price format allows medium-cost sellers to
submit offers that are competitive against low-cost sellers, hurting both efficiency and
cost-effectiveness. The endogenous reference price outperforms the exogenous reference
price in terms of cost-effectiveness by increasing participation and reducing rents.
